@section intro Introduction

Squash is an abstraction layer which provides a single API to access
many compression libraries.

For a high-level overview of how to use Squash, please see the
[Squash User Guide](@ref md_docs_user-guide).

@subsection bindings Bindings

Squash is written in C and has minimal hard dependencies, meaning it
should be straightforward to create bindings for many languages.  In
order help with testing, bindings are generally distributed with
Squash.

Squash currently supports the following languages:

- C
- Vala

We hope to add more soon.  If you're interested in helping, please

@subsection plugins Plugins

The actual integration with individual compression libraries is done
through plugins which can be installed separately from Squash itself
and are not loaded until they are required.  This allows Squash
consumers to utilize a great many compression algorithms without
rewriting code or unnecessary bloat.  Plugins need not be distributed
with Squash, though it is preferred.

Squash currently contains plugins for the following libraries:

- [Brotli](@ref md_plugins_brotli_brotli)
- [bsc](@ref md_plugins_bsc_bsc)
- [bzip2](@ref md_plugins_bzip2_bzip2)
