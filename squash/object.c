/**
 * @defgroup SquashObject SquashObject
 * @brief Base object for several Squash types.
 *
 * @ref SquashObject is designed to provide a lightweight
 * reference-counted type which can be used as a base class for other
 * types in Squash.
 *
 * @section Subclassing Subclassing
 *
 * Subclassing @ref SquashObject is relatively straightforward.  The
 * first step is to embed @ref SquashObject in your object.  Assuming
 * you're inheriting directly from @ref SquashObject, your code would
 * look something like this:
 *
 * @code
 * struct MyObject {
 *   SquashObject base_object;
 *   char* greeting;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you are subclassing another type (which inherits, possibly
 * indirectly, from @ref SquashObject) then you should use that type
 * instead.
 *
 * Next, you should to create an *_init function which takes an
 * existing instance of your class, chains up to the *_init function
 * provided by your base class, and initializes any fields you want
 * initialized:
 *
 * @code
 * void
 * my_object_init (MyObject* obj,
 *                 char* greeting,
 *                 SquashDestroyNotify destroy_notify) {
 *   squash_object_init ((SquashObject*) obj, false, destroy_notify);
 *
 *   obj->greeting = strdup (greeting);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Of course, whatever is created must be destroyed, so you'll also
 * want to create a *_destroy method to be called when the reference
 * count reaches 0.  Destroy any of your fields first, then chain up
 * to the base class' *_destroy function:
 *
 * @code
 * void
 * my_object_destroy (MyObject* obj) {
 *   if (obj->greeting != NULL) {
 *     free (obj->greeting);
 *   }
 *
 *   squash_object_destroy (obj);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If your class is not abstract (it is meant to be instantiated, not
 * just subclassed), you should create two more functions.  First, a
 * *_free function which will call your *_destroy function and release
 * any memory you've allocated for the struct itself:
 *
 * @code
 * void
 * my_object_free (MyObject* obj) {
 *   my_object_destroy (obj);
 *   free (obj);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Finally, a constructor:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject*
 * my_object_new (char* greeting) {
 *   MyObject obj;
 *
 *   obj = malloc (sizeof (MyObject));
 *   my_object_init (obj, greeting, (SquashDestroyNotify) my_object_free);
 *
 *   return obj;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
