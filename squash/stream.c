     flushing or finishing with arbitrarily large inputs, we first try
     to process as much input as we can.  So, when someone calls
     squash_stream_flush or squash_stream finish Squash may, depending
     on the stream state, first call the process function.  Note that
     Squash will not flush a stream before finishing it (unless there
     is logic to do so in the plugin) as it could cause an increase in
     the output size (it does with zlib).

     One interesting consequence of this is that the stream_state
     field may not be what you're expecting.  If an earlier operation
     returned SQUASH_PROCESSING, stream_type may never transition to
     the new value.  In this case, the stream_type does accurately

     There are a few cases where this might reasonably be a problem:

      * Decompression streams which know the exact size of the

        data at the end, such as a footer or EOS marker.

      * Compression streams writing to a fixed buffer with a size of
        less than or equal to max_compressed_size bytes.  This is a
        pretty reasonable thing to do, since you might want to only
        bother using compression if you can achieve a certain ratio.
